// Android doesn't allow http requests by default and to change that, I only found a solution where I would have to eject the expo app
// An alternative is to use https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started to create a https tunnel to the localhost api and use the returned https address
// Somehow the email notification doesn't work anymore - test that on IOS
// After having installed ngrok, run `./ngrok http 8000` in terminal and updated the rootEndPoint for android to the given https url
